# Auto-RTL-using-Sass
Creating a Right to Left page for a webpage from a Left to Right page is a very tedious job. This project helps in automation of creation of RTL pages.
If you just change the variables declared at the top in the _mixin file for your RTL file. Like $direction: 'rtl',
,$side1: 'right',$side2: 'left' you will get automatically generated response for you rtl files that is opposite to your ltr file
